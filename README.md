# Utility-Based Reinforcement Learning with Attention for Pricing Optimization

This repository provides a reproducible implementation of the framework proposed in:

**Utility-Based Reinforcement Learning with Attention Mechanisms for Pricing Optimization in Automotive Maintenance Services**

---

## Overview

The framework combines:
- Utility-based reward modeling (profitability + retention)
- Tabular Q-learning
- Attention-based feature weighting
- SHAP explainability and stability analysis

Due to confidentiality constraints, a paper-faithful **synthetic dataset** is provided.
